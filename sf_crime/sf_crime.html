            <h4>Pandemic-Induced Restrictions Force Criminals to Alter Behaviors</h4>

            <p>On March 17, 2020, the San Francisco Department of Public Health put a shelter-in-place order into effect in response to the coronavirus outbreak. 
              Activities were restricted to those deemed essential, and the once bustling city came to a sudden standstill. 
              Mayor London Breed on the eve of the lockdown proclaimed, "the most important thing you can do is remain home as much as possible."<sup>1</sup> 
              The public agreed and began to adjust to life during a pandemic. 
              In the year that followed, commuters and would-be tourists refrained from travel, businesses modified hours and modes of operation, and events were held virtually, if not postponed or canceled altogether. 
              Social, commercial, and even religious interactions were radically changing in the Golden City.
            </p>
            <p>
              Broad restrictions slowed the spread of COVID-19, but they also inadvertently impacted crime. 
              A decline in total incidents was a predictable consequence given people's newfound reluctance to leave their homes for fear of infection; 
              more time spent indoors translated to fewer opportunities for criminals to prey. 
              However, the effects were not uniform across all types of crime nor every city neighborhood. 
              I learned this firsthand in February 2021 when my home in the Outer Richmond was burglarized. 
              During that same week, the Richmond district police station reported an alarming 367 percent rise in burglaries year-to-date.<sup>2</sup> 
              A lack of pedestrian traffic had compelled thieves searching for cash, jewelry, and other valuables to target residences and businesses with greater frequency.
            </p>
            <p>
              This research brief is aimed at surfacing crime trends in San Francisco since the city's sweeping adoption of pandemic-fighting measures. 
              Police reports filed before and after the lockdown are analyzed and charted by incident attributes such as category, location, and time. 
              The findings reveal dramatic shifts in the tendencies of lawbreakers, some of which indicate heightened threats to public safety. 
              In order for law enforcement to effectively and efficiently combat crime, policing and prevention strategies must adapt to these changing behaviors.

            <p>
              In the interests of transparency, interagency collaboration, and public participation, many government entities follow open data practices. 
              The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) publishes incident reports via <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783" target="_blank">DataSF</a>, a municipal organization that empowers the use of data for purposes of improving public programs and services. 
              Their rich dataset includes observations spanning variables <i>Analysis Neighborhood</i>, <i>Incident Category</i>, <i>Incident Datetime</i>, <i>Latitude</i>, <i>Longitude</i>, <i>Police District</i>, and more. 
              Although DataSF makes it easy to view incident reports and create custom visualizations directly on its website, researchers wanting greater control over the quality and presentation of data can retrieve raw records from an application programming interface, or API.
            </p>
            <p>
              This researcher fetched and cleansed SFPD records with Python. 
              First, an HTTP <span class='code'>GET</span> request was sent to the API. 
              An <i>Incident Date</i> query parameter filtered the JSON response to approximately 216,000 incidents occurring between March 17, 2019 and March 16, 2021. 
              Next, the response was converted into a Pandas DataFrame and subjected to a data quality assessment. 
              The dataset proved to be sufficiently unique, complete, and timely, but it was not without several issues, inconsistent categorical values in particular. 
              Then, discoveries of dirty data were corrected using the <span class='code'>FILLNA</span> and <span class='code'>REPLACE</span> methods. 
              For example, <i>Incident Category</i> labels "Other" and "Other Offenses" were remapped to "Other Miscellaneous"—a third semantically equivalent label—thereby eliminating two redundant categories. 
              Finally, the DataFrame was sliced with the <span class='code'>LOC</span> property. 
              A conditional expression separated incidents occurring prior to the lockdown from those following it. 
              As a result of collection, transformation, cleansing, and organization, the data was ready for analysis.

            <p>
              Stringent restrictions imposed by San Francisco Health Officer Tomás Aragón catalyzed a precipitous drop in crime. 
              Prior to Order C19-07, the first citywide shelter-in-place order issued in the United States, aggregate movement had been relatively stable despite growing fears of COVID-19. 
              In a 2020 annual report, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency stated a 1.5 percent year-over-year rise in ridership, i.e., average weekday boardings, in February, the last full month before the lockdown.<sup>3</sup> 
              This sustained level of activity was reflected in the rate of incidents. 
              As shown in Figure 1, the average daily incident count (ADIC) for the sixty-day period immediately preceding the lockdown was only marginally lower than the ADIC for the full year—318 incidents compared to 337. 
              The order, effective beginning March 17, 2020, caused activity to slow and, consequently, the rate of incidents to plummet. 
              Ridership decreased by 86.7 percent in April, and the ADIC fell by a third to 218 incidents in the first sixty days under lockdown. 
              Crime rebounded slightly after initial restrictions were eased but remained well below the previous year's level due to ongoing social distancing measures and diminished activity.

              While the pandemic response curbed crime throughout most of San Francisco, it disproportionately lowered incident rates for <a href="https://www.sanfranciscopolice.org/your-sfpd/sfpd-stations/station-finder" target="_blank">SFPD districts</a> encompassing areas of commerce, entertainment, and tourism. 
              As shown in Figure 2, districts within the city's historically vibrant northeast quadrant—Central, Mission, Northern, Southern, and Tenderloin—observed significantly larger declines in incidents than did other more residential districts. 
              Central, which includes Chinatown, Financial District, and Fisherman's Wharf, recorded 8,526 (44.6%) fewer incidents in the year after the start of the lockdown, the biggest drop among all ten districts. 
              Northern, which includes Civic Center, Japantown, and Polk Gulch, narrowly edged Southern and Mission to log the second biggest slide with 4,894 (26.9%) less incidents. 
              In comparison, total incidents fell by only 3,774 (16.5%) in Park, Richmond, and Taraval combined. 
              Interdistrict disparities in the impact of COVID-19 on crime were even more pronounced in Bayview and Ingleside, where the numbers of incidents remained virtually unchanged from the prior year.

                      S1P3: For local law enforcement to adapt, policing tactics and crime-curbing initiatives must leverage insights from recent criminal activities.
                      S1P3: By leveraging these insights, local officials and law enforcement can adapt policing and crime prevention strategies to new criminal behaviors.
                      S3P1: Examples of ongoing in-person activities throughout the city: telecommuting, distance learning, nightlife, shopping, 
                      S3P1: Ordered many businesses to cease operations and individuals to shelter in place.
                      S3P1: Prior to Order C19-07, the first citywide shelter-in-place order issued in the United States, aggregate movement had remained relatively unchanged from previous years despite growing fears of COVID-19.
                      S3P1: In the first sixty days under lockdown, the ADIC fell by 31.6% from the previous sixty-day period to 218 incidents. 
                      S3P1: This trend of reduced crime would persist even after initial restrictions eased, likely due to ongoing social distancing practices that increase physical space between criminals and their marks.
                      S3P2: Mission (Castro District and Dolores Park); Southern (Chase Center, Oracle Park, Yerba Buena), and Tenderloin (TBD).
                      S3P2: Northern, which includes Civic Center, Japantown, and Polk Gulch, logged 4,894 (26.9%) less incidents and thus narrowly surpassed Southern and Mission as having the second biggest slide by total.

              <!--When recorded and analyzed, attributes of criminal activity such as category, location, and time can reveal behavioral patterns of perpetrators. 
              Furthermore, a change in pattern or frequency observed after the enactment of a new measure can help evaluators determine its effectiveness. 
              Imagine, for example, a crime analyst uncovers a considerably higher rate of disorderly conduct around Chase Center on evenings of concerts compared to those of sporting events. 
              Local officials may mandate additional security or limit alcohol sales during concerts in response. 
              If nightly incidents decline significantly in the ensuing months, then the measure is successful at maintaining the peace. 
              A deeper understanding of criminal behavior leads to predictive policing methods, efficient use of resources, and, ultimately, safer neighborhoods.
