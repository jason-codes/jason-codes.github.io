            <h2>San Francisco Crime after COVID-19 Outbreak:</h2>
            <h4>Pandemic-Induced Restrictions Force Criminals to Alter Behaviors</h4>

            <p>On March 17, 2020, the San Francisco Department of Public Health put a shelter-in-place order (C19-07) into effect in response to the coronavirus outbreak. 
              Activities were restricted to those deemed essential, and the once bustling city came to a sudden standstill. 
              Mayor London Breed on the eve of the lockdown proclaimed, "the most important thing you can do is remain home as much as possible."<sup>1</sup> 
              The public agreed and began to adjust to life during a pandemic. 
              In the year that followed, commuters and would-be tourists refrained from travel, businesses modified hours and modes of operation, and events were held virtually, if not postponed or canceled altogether. 
              Social and commercial interactions were radically changing in the Golden City.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the objective of pandemic-time restrictions is to slow the spread of COVID-19, they inadvertently affect crime rates. 
              A decline in overall incidents is a predictable consequence given people's reluctance to leave their homes for fear of infection; 
              less time spent in public and commercial spaces translates to fewer opportunities for criminals to prey. 
              However, the effects are not uniform across all types of crime nor every city neighborhood. 
              I learned this firsthand in February 2021 when my home in the Outer Richmond was burglarized. 
              During that same week, the Richmond district police station reported an alarming 367% rise in burglaries year-to-date.<sup>2</sup> 
              The lack of pedestrian traffic had forced criminals searching for cash, jewelry, and other valuables to target residences and businesses with greater frequency.
            </p>
            <p>
              This research brief is aimed at surfacing trends in San Francisco crime since the city's sweeping adoption of pandemic-fighting measures. 
              Police reports filed before and after the lockdown are analyzed and charted by incident attributes such as category, location, and time. 
              The findings reveal dramatic shifts in the tendencies of lawbreakers, some of which indicate heightened threats to public safety. 
              For local law enforcement to adapt, policing tactics and crime-curbing initiatives must leverage insights from recent criminal activities.

            <h4 class="spacer-150">Data Collection</h4>
            <p>
              In the interests of transparency, interagency collaboration, and public participation, many government entities follow open data practices. 
              The San Francisco Police Department publishes incident reports through <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783" download target="_blank">DataSF</a>, a municipal organization that empowers the use of data for purposes of improving public programs and services. 
              This rich dataset includes observations spanning variables <i>Analysis Neighborhood</i>, <i>Incident Category</i>, <i>Incident Datetime</i>, <i>Latitude</i>, <i>Longitude</i>, <i>Police District</i>, and more. 
              Although DataSF makes it easy to view incident reports and create custom visualizations on its website, researchers wanting greater control over the quality and presentation of data can retrieve raw records from an application programming interface (API) for further cleansing and analysis.

              <!--Crime statistics aid law enforcement in the allocation of patrol resources and assessment of crime-curbing initiatives. <sup>2</sup> 
              When recorded and analyzed, attributes of criminal activity such as category, location, and time can reveal behavioral patterns of perpetrators. 
              Furthermore, a change in pattern or frequency observed after the enactment of a new measure can help evaluators determine its effectiveness. 
              Imagine, for example, a crime analyst uncovers a considerably higher rate of disorderly conduct around Chase Center on evenings of concerts compared to those of sporting events. 
              Local officials may mandate additional security or limit alcohol sales during concerts in response. 
              If nightly incidents decline significantly in the ensuing months, then the measure is successful at maintaining the peace. 
              A deeper understanding of criminal behavior leads to predictive policing methods, efficient use of resources, and, ultimately, safer neighborhoods. -->
